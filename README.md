Project Sprint 2

Project Description:

This is a continuation of the Sprint 1 project.
In the final stage of the project, you will continue to fulfill your role as a junior data professional for Store 1, building on the foundation laid in the first project. This time, the store has established more complex requirements to deepen its knowledge of its customers' behavior. Its goal is to better personalize your advertising campaigns by analyzing more complex data, such as customer segmentation and consumption trends over time.
